5.1. Can you explain the copy (cp ../temp-* .) command used above?

The command serves to copy all the files started with "temp-" created before to the current directory.

5.2. Can you explain why, in this case, we did not have to do git init?

Because the current repository is already a git repository.

5.3. Can you commit the files copied? What do you need to do? Execute the commands that are needed.

Yes, by using the commands "git add" and "git commit".
